What we got last night was ~4% by molecule.  That's a weird measure of alcohol.  Paul McGuire suggested the acronym % ABM:  percent alcohol by molecule.  :)

OK.  There are two corrections to be made.  The big one I missed -- my only excuse was that it was too late and I was in a hurry; sorry guys!! -- is the molecular weight of the components.  H2O is 18 grams/mol,  CH3CH2OH is 46 grams/mol.  

So let's take the spectrum below.  The methyl peak -CH3 is the cleanest for measuring the ethanol content, and is 6% the size of the H2O peak.  Two protons on water, three on the -CH3, so we take 6.06% * 2/3 = 4.04%.  This is a measure of number of molecules:  for every 100 water molecules there are 4.04 ethanol molecules.  And I'm still not quite there.  The -OH in ethanol is almost certainly sitting on the water peak.  So we actually have only 96 H2O for each 4.04 ethanol molecules.

But we have to correct each measure by the molecular weight:

H2O:  96 molecules * 18 grams/mol = 1728 grams   relative to    ethanol: 4.04 molecules * 46 grams/mol = 185.8 grams            

So the weight percent =  185.8 / (1728+185.8) = 9.7% by weight

2nd correction is to correct for specific gravity:   9.7% * 1 / 0.78 = 12.4% by vol alcohol for barleywine

The prebarrel gave 5.68% initially, and that ends up with 11.7% by vol ethanol.
